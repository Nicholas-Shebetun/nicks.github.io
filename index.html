    <strong><p>Welcome to my page!</p></strong>
    <p>I built the page using GitHub Pages. I found it using a tutorial provided by a TA, and used the tutorial to set up a GitHub Page in a repository. I added a _config.yml file to choose the theme of the page
    and an index.html file to display the contents of the page. I experimented with a few features like posts and different themes and settled on this simple design.</p>
    <p>The biggest difficulty was waiting for several minutes for the page to update every time. Due to my programming style being incremental with frequent updates, this made making any sort of change to the website 
    very slow and cumbersome to deal with. It encourages me to make an html file externally and then pasting it in when I'm ready.</p>
